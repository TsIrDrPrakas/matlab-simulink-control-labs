## 🔬 Laboratory Overview

This lab series covers four essential topics in classical control systems, each designed to reinforce key theoretical concepts through hands-on simulation in MATLAB & Simulink.

| Lab No. | Title                                                       | Key Focus                              |
|--------:|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Lab 1   | Introduction to MATLAB & Simulink                           | Transfer functions, `stepinfo()`, plots |
| Lab 2   | Transient Response of Second-Order Systems                  | Damping ratio (ζ), natural freq (ωₙ), overshoot |
| Lab 3   | PID Controller Design                                       | Manual & auto tuning using `pidtune()` |
| Lab 4   | Stability Analysis using Bode & Nyquist Plots              | Gain margin, phase margin, frequency domain |
